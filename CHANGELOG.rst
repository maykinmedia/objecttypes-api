2.2.1 (2024-08-29)
------------------

**New features**

* made user emails unique to prevent two users logging in with the same email, causing an error (maykinmedia/open-api-framework#39)
* updated open-api-framework to 0.8.0, which includes adding CSRF, CSP and HSTS settings (#124).
  All new environment variables are added to the `documentation <https://objects-and-objecttypes-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/config.html>`_

.. warning::
    User email addresses will now be unique on a database level. The database migration will fail if there are already
    two or more users with the same email address. You must ensure this is not the case before upgrading.

.. warning::

    SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS has been added with a default of 31536000 seconds, ensure that
    before upgrading to this version of open-api-framework, your entire application is served
    over HTTPS, otherwise this setting can break parts of your application (see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/middleware/#http-strict-transport-security)

.. warning::

    Because the caching backend was changed to Redis, existing deployments must
    add a Redis container or Redis instance (see ``Installation > Environment
    configuration reference`` in the documentation on how to configure) the
    connection with Redis.

.. warning::

    The service name for Elastic APM is now configurable via the
    ``ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME`` environment variable. The default value changed
